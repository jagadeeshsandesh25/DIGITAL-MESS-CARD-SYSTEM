// This file acts as a placeholder or entry point.
// The actual content generation is handled by the controller and included layout.

// Ensure direct access is prevented if needed, although the controller handles logic.
// For now, we'll assume the controller sets the $content variable and includes the layout.
// If you want this file to be independently includable, you might put logic here to call the controller method,
// but typically, the controller is the entry point.

echo "<p>This page is managed by WaiterOrderController. If you see this, the controller might not have set the content correctly or included the layout.</p>";

// Example of how a controller might use this:
/*
if (isset($content_from_controller)) {
    echo $content_from_controller;
} else {
    echo "<p>Error loading waiter orders list.</p>";
}
